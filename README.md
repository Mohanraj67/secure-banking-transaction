# secure-banking-transaction
 Goal: Design a secure and efficient E-Payment protocol. 
 
 Description: The new  protocol offers an extra layer of protection for cardholders and  merchants. Customers are asked to enter an additional password after  checkout completion to verify themselves, the  authentication is done directly between the cardholder and card issuer  using the issuer security certificate and without involving third party(electronic commerce or e-commerce provides participants). 
 Benefits: 
 1. Convenient and save time. 
 2. E-commerce transactions can be  categorized into business to business (B2B), business to consumer  (B2C), consumer to consumer (C2C), and public/private sectors to  government.
 we focus on B2C transactions in this project.
